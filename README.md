# docker-compose-media-center

This repository contains the Docker compose files for standing up an entire Servarr
stack along with other supporting tools and services best suited for an at-home
NAS or media center, of course based on Linux and using Cloudflare tunnels to expose
your services (if you were wondering why there isn't a reverse proxy in the stack).

## Useful Resources To Have On-hand

Here are some useful resources to keep on hand as you go through the instuctions
below for setting up the services contained in the Docker compose files in this
repository:

- [Servarr Wiki](https://wiki.servarr.com/): Best place to start to get to
understand some of the services that are setup in the set of Docker compose
files in this repository, what they are, and how to set them up and troubleshoot
them.
- [LinuxServer.io](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/container-execution/):
The How To section here is full of a lot of quick introductory material for not
only Docker, Docker Compose, and other good material on what forms the foundation
of many of the concepts you will need to understand utilizing the Docker compose
files in this repository as well as following along with the instuctions below.
Not only that but [LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) has built and
maintains many of the Docker images and formed, to a large extent, the formatting
and structure of the Docker compose files in this repository.
- [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/): Collected here are a great set of
documents that somewhat explain the services but is more of an excellent source
for general best practices as well as offering tips and providing help for some
edge cases you may encounter.

## Installation and Setup

The setup process has been simplified with a consolidated docker-compose.yml file. Follow these steps to deploy your homelab services:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.

2. Create a `media` network with:

    ```shell
    docker network create \
      --driver=bridge \
      --gateway=172.16.0.1 \
      --ip-range=172.16.0.0/24 \
      --subnet=172.16.0.0/16 \
      -o "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc"="true" \
      -o "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade"="true" \
      -o "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4"="0.0.0.0" \
      -o "com.docker.network.bridge.name"="media" \
      -o "com.docker.network.driver.mtu"="1500" \
      media
    ```

3. Copy the `environment_variables.env.example` file to `environment_variables.env` and update the variables according to your configuration:
    ```shell
    cp environment_variables.env.example environment_variables.env
    nano environment_variables.env  # Or use your preferred text editor
    ```

    **IMPORTANT NOTE:** You don't need to complete all values at once. Fill in the essential ones to start and update others as you set up services. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.

4. Create the necessary directories for service configuration as described in the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) section.

4.b First thing we do is make sure the portainer Docker compose file is in the portainer/ directory. This is because Portainer is weird and launches with a stack named after the parent directory to the image it is launched from. This way in our case it will be portainer now:
    ```shell
    cd portainer/
    docker compose --file docker-compose-portainer.yaml --env-file ../environment_variables.env up --detach
    ```
    Remember to go back to the root project's folder with:
    ```shell
    cd ../
    ```

5. Deploy all services at once with:
    ```shell
    docker-compose --env-file environment_variables.env up -d
    ```

    Or deploy specific service groups by using labels:
    ```shell
    # Example: Deploy only download clients
    docker-compose up -d --scale "group=downloaders"
    
    # Example: Deploy only the Servarr stack
    docker-compose up -d --scale "group=servarr"
    ```

6. Access Portainer at `http://your-server-ip:9000` to manage your containers through a web interface.

7. For Kometa scheduling, add the following to the `jobs.ini` file in the `ofelia` config directory:
    ```ini
    [job-exec "kometa daily"]
      schedule = 45 11 * * *
      container = kometa
      command = photoprism index --cleanup
      no-overlap = true
    ```

## Directory Structure

In order to start, you need to create several directories to house the configurations for each service and where the Docker container will persist configurations locally between reboots, restarts, etc. This maps directly to the `CONFIG_BASE_DIR` directory in the `.env` file that we will get to later.

```shell
export CONFIG_BASE_DIR=/volume1/services # substitute for your path/preferences
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}
```

This sets the `CONFIG_BASE_DIR` directory that will store all of the subsequent directories for their Docker configurations. **NOTE:** I have marked items below I consider _optional_ but note that the files included here _will_ install them all unless you have commented them out as well. If you do not create every directory below and its subsequent service are later set up to be running and available to use. Whether you use them or not you may find you would like to try them later so my recommendation is to leave them as is and you can return later to remove them as you require. If you do skip some of the services marked `optional` in creating the directories below (highlighted by the `# optional ...` comments below then do your best to find the [environment variables](#environment-variables)) and comment those out as well (to keep down the noise in your `.env` file). To create each of the directories run the following after the command above:

```shell
# Media Center Core
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/bazarr
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/deluge
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/emby
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/grafana/{database,storage,snmp}
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/homarr/{configs,icons,data}
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/jellyfin
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/jellyseerr
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/lidarr
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/nextcloud-aio  # For potential future use
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/notifiarr
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/ofelia
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/photoprism/{database,storage}
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/portainer
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/prometheus/{config,data}
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/prowlarr
mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/qbittorrent

mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/pinchflat/{config,downloads}

# Optional/Inactive Services (commented out)
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/caddy
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/delugevpn
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/gluetun
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/immich/{cache,database}
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/kometa
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/mylar3
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/nzbget
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/overseerr
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/paperless-ngx
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/plex
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/sabnzbd
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/sabnzbdvpn
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/searxng
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/tailscale
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/tautulli
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/transmission
# mkdir -p ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/transmission-openvpn
```

Copy the resources for **Ofelia** and **Prometheus** to their respective directories:
```shell
cp 'project-folder'/resources/ofelia/jobs.ini ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/ofelia/jobs.ini
cp 'project-folder'/resources/prometheus/config/prometheus.yaml ${CONFIG_BASE_DIR}/prometheus/config/prometheus.yaml
```

For **Grafana** you will want to import the dashboard from `resources/grafana/servarr_dashboard.json` into the utility through the UI after the service has been started.

## Environment Variables

In `environment_variables.env.example` are the environment variables to use for
the Docker Compose files. You will want to copy this to `.env` and modify the
file according to the values for your setup. Here are all the environment
variables and their purpose:

- `BAZARR_API_KEY`: The API key for Bazarr
- `BOOKS_DIR_LOCAL`: The directory to keep Book files that are organized
  locally on disk (i.e. `/volume1/books`)
- `BOOKS_DIR_RELATIVE`: The directory to keep Book files that are organized
  _relative_ to the container (i.e. **not** the actual location of the files on
  disk e.g. `/books` => `${BOOKS_DIR_LOCAL}` e.g. `/books` => `/volume1/books`)
- `COMICS_DIR_LOCAL`: The directory to keep Comic Book files that are organized
  locally on disk (i.e. `/volume1/books`)
- `COMICS_DIR_RELATIVE`: The directory to keep Comic Book files that are
  organized _relative_ to the container (i.e. **not** the actual location of the
  files on disk e.g. `/books` => `${BOOKS_DIR_LOCAL}` e.g. `/comics` =>
  `/volume1/comics`)
- `CONFIG_BASE_DIR`: The base directory where each of the containers will have
  their configurations persistently stored between reboots, restarts, etc. (e.g.
  `/volume1/docker`)... and will serve the container the directory (e.g.
  _Deluge_ => `/volume1/docker`/deluge, _Plex_ =>
  `/volume1/docker`/plex, _Tailscale_ => `/volume1/docker`/tailscale, etc.) =>
  (e.g. Deluge => `deluge`, Plex => `plex`,
  Tailscale => `tailscale`, etc.)
- `DOCUMENTS_DIR_LOCAL`: The directory of locally stored Document files

**Port Variables:**
All service ports have been moved to environment variables for better control and flexibility. 
This allows you to easily change ports to avoid conflicts with other services on your system.
To modify a port, simply update its corresponding variable in the `environment_variables.env` file.
For example: `DELUGE_PORT_GUI=8112` or `PLEX_PORT_WEB=32400`.
No port conflicts have been detected in the default configuration.

- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_COMPLETE_LOCAL`: The directory to keep completely downloaded
  files locally on disk (i.e. `/volume1/Downloads/complete`)
- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_COMPLETE_RELATIVE`: The directory to keep completely downloaded
  files _relative_ to the container (i.e. **not** the actual location of the
  files on disk e.g. `/complete` => `${DOWNLOADS_DIR_COMPLETE_LOCAL}` e.g.
  `/complete` => `/volume1/Downloads/complete`)
- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_INCOMPLETE_LOCAL`: The directory to keep incompletely downloaded
  files locally on disk (i.e. `/volume1/Downloads/incomplete`)
- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_INCOMPLETE_RELATIVE`: The directory to keep incompletely
  downloaded files _relative_ to the container (i.e. **not** the actual location
  of the files on disk e.g. `/incomplete` => `${DOWNLOADS_DIR_INCOMPLETE_LOCAL}`
  e.g. `/incomplete` => `/volume1/Downloads/watch`)
- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_WATCH_LOCAL`: The directory to keep files to be watched
  locally on disk (i.e. `/volume1/Downloads/watch`)
- `DOWNLOADS_DIR_WATCH_RELATIVE`: The directory to keep files to be watched
  _relative_ to the container (i.e. **not** the actual location of the files on
  disk e.g. `/watch` => `${DOWNLOADS_DIR_WATCH_LOCAL}` e.g. `/watch` =>
  `/volume1/Downloads/watch`)

- `GRAFANA_DATABASE_NAME`: The name for the Grafana database
- `GRAFANA_DATABASE_USER`: The user for the Grafana database
- `GRAFANA_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for the Grafana database
- `HEALTH_CHECK_HOST`: Hostname to use for VPN health checks (e.g.:
  `google.com`)
- `HOMEASSISTANT_PGID`: The group ID for the running process in the container

  containers for and support Home Assistant will have their configurations
  persistently stored between reboots, restarts, etc. (e.g.
  `/volume1/homeassistant-docker`)... and will serve the container the directory
  (e.g. _NodeRED_ => `/volume1/homeassistant-docker`/nodered, _ZigBee_ =>
  `/volume1/homeassistant-docker`/zigbee, _Home Assistant_ => 
  `/volume1/homeassistant-docker`/homeassistant, etc.) =>  (e.g. NodeRED =>
  `nodered`, ZigBee => `zigbee`, Home Assistant => `homeassistant`, etc.). So,
  in this example, it is simply the home where each of these containers
  configurations will live: `/volume1/homeassistant-docker`

## TODO

Now personal notes to myself on some of that which remains:

- **P0**: Fix prometheus
- **P1:** Consider adding [Lemmy](https://blog.colic.io/2023/07/07/self-hosting-lemmy-a-step-by-step-guide-with-docker-compose/)
- **P1:** Add instructions for wiring everything together (with pictures?)
- **P1:** Add instructions for Gluetun containers
- **P3:** See if `SearXNG` needs more tuning and add it?
- **P3:** Add documentation or maybe breakout Home Assistant
